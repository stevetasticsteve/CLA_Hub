## Participation
- 29/7/19 Steve went with Ulumo for the first time chopping down trees
- 30/7/19 Steve went a second time
- 31/7/19 Rhett went with Simon for the first time

## What happened
Ulumo invited me to help him chop down a tree the traditional way with axes. We met at his house and
hiked out to the tree. A path had been cut with machetes  to the tree and some guys were already
there striking the tree with axes. We worked at cutting a notch in the tree from the backside of
where we wanted it to fall. Eventually the tree fell.

## Differences between participations
When Rhett went it was just him and Simon.

## Missionary interpretation
I think they do this for fun

## National interpretation
Ulumo said he was doing it because he wanted to bulas the garden with diwai.
