<h1>OCM reference</h1>
<p>OCM stands for Outline of Cultural Materials. It is a simple code system that enables Culture Events to be
tagged and grouped together to build a picture of an area of culture</p>
<p>CLAHub's tag system is very flexible and you can use whatever tags you like, however there is built in
support for OCM tags. </p>
<p>The first tag is '1-1 Geography & Weather'. That's quite a bit of typing if you want use that tag.
For convinience all you need to do is type '1-1' and CLAHub will write the rest of the tag for you. '1-1'
will become '1-1 Geography & Weather' automatically on save. An entry will also be created on the OCM 1-1
page. Later on you can browse there and see all the CEs with any data on Geography & Weather in one place.</p>
<p>You as a cultural investigator will have to analyse the data from those Culture Events to draw conclusions
on that area of culture, but at least CLAHub is doing the hard work of organising and tagging!</p>
