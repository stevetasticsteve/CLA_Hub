# Contributing
CLAHub has started as a single person project to meet the culture filing needs of a missionary team. I'll be continuing
refine and develop CLAHub to be a useful tool for our team as needed.

If more people are interested in using CLAHub for culture filing I'll maintain the project as long as it is being used.

Contributors to CLAHub are greatly appreciated, but at the moment with just our team using CLAHub further contributors
are icing on the cake rather than essential, there aren't missionaries (other than myself) relying on it.

If contributing sounds fun here are some ways to help:

### Contribute code
You know Python? Why not learn a bit of django and contribute. See the 
[issues](https://github.com/stevetasticsteve/CLA_Hub/issues) page for jobs I've identified, but feel free to improve the
code in whatever way you like.
JS and HTML programmers would be appreciated to look over the templates - I'm a Python guy.

Get in touch if you're at all interested, or interested in learning Python to help out, or intersted in teaching me how
to Python properly :)

### Contribute feedback
I'd love to hear any suggestions from people who use CLAHub. Even hearing people are using it would be a big 
encouragement to work on it some more rather than shelve it once it's 'good enough'. Use Github's 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/stevetasticsteve/CLA_Hub/issues/new) to post a new request, suggestion or bug report.

### Contribute documentation
Currently there's nothing written about where CLAHub fits into learning an unwritten, undocumented minority language.
Nor is there a user manual for how to use it's features.
