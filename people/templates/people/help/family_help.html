<h1>CLAHub help</h1>
<h2>Family field</h2>
<p>
    Recording family information for people is a tedious and complex task. Unfortunately because there are so
    many exceptions to the rules CLAHub isn't able to automate the family tree building process. CLAHub has chosen a
    flexible and mostly manual approach to recording family information.
</p>

<p>
    You're able to write anything you want in the family field. CLAHub won't try to enforce database integrity rules,
    or automatically fill in family connections.
    It will however assume that whenever you type any numbers you intend for those to become hyperlinks. Every profile
    in CLAHub has a unique numeric key. This numeric key can be seen in the url for the profile you're interested in.
</p>

<p>
    Upon saving a profile CLAHub will read the contents of the family field and replace any numbers with a hyperlink to
    the profile with that numeric key (if it exists) and display the linked profile's name.
</p>

<p>
    For example typing:
    <ul>Brother: 1</ul>
    Will become
    <ul>Brother: <a href="#">Brother's name</a></ul>
</p>
